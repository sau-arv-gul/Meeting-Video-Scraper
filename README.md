# üìΩÔ∏è Meeting Video Scraper
Meeting Video Scraper is a Python-based tool,  developed to scrape and download publicly available government meeting videos from various government or organizational websites.
These videos cover sessions like City Council meetings, Finance Committees, Planning Commissions, Zoning Boards, and other civic organizations.
Each website has a different layout and structure, so the project uses dedicated scraper classes tailored to each platform.
